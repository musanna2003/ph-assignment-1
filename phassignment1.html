            <p>Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in its fight against poverty. With microcredit
                 and social business models, we've shown that growth can be inclusive, empowering marginalized
                  communities. But to continue this momentum, global collaboration is key. We must focus on
                   reducing inequality, building an economy that works for everyone, and ensuring that
                    no one is left behind in our journey toward a brighter future.
